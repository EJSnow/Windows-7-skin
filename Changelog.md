# Changelog for Windows 7 skin
## v1.2
This update brings some significant changes to the skin that make the look even closer to the Windows 7 start menu. I do need to investigate a little more (NEED. AERO.) to make sure everything's correct, but for now this skin is ready. During development, had a fun time where half the options didn't work right. Don't worry. You won't get that alpha version.

Changes:

- Updated the submenu bitmaps to be more accurate.
- The start menu now automatically scales to 125% scaling, and as a result requires Open-Shell 4.4.153 or later to work properly.
- Removed the Large, Medium, and Small reflection image options to decrease the overall size of the skin (I don't think it worked).
- Added a new reflection image extracted from Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 (it doesn't look quite right, the masks for it probably need adjusting)
- Added a new option for user image glare using bitmaps from Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1. Now the original glare is available.
- Added start button images from Windows 7. Note: the images are scaled for specific dpis. More in the new readme in the release package. These replace the previous single start button image.
- Oh yeah. Updated the XML so that the start button and taskbar textures aren't automatically applied. Use the readme to complete the Windows 7 look.
- Because of this, the taskbar textures and start button images no longer need to be copied to %localappdata%\OpenShell.
- Also added a shortcut in the release package to %localappdata%\OpenShell to make it easier to copy the icons.
