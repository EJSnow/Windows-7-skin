# Windows 7 skin
This is a Windows 7-style skin for Open-Shell Menu. You can download Open-Shell Menu [here](https://github.com/open-shell-menu/releases/latest/). I tweaked the built-in Windows Aero skin as well as [this guy's](https://github.com/CTVCAM8) Windows 7 start menu clone ([link](http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5824)) to get the look as close as I could to the real Windows 7 start menu. Mostly I just changed some of the default options, and removed some bitmaps. It should work all right, but if you do find something that isn't quite right, [submit an issue](https://github.com/EJSnow/Windows-7-skin/issues/new/choose) and I'll look into it. The skin was built with [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/).

## Installation
1. Download the skin from [Releases](https://github.com/EJSnow/Windows-7-skin/releases/latest/).
2. Unzip the archive anywhere you want (just be sure you know where it is.)
3. Copy the skin to your Open-Shell skins directory (typically C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins).
4. Copy the icons folder to this folder: C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\OpenShell.
5. Optionally, to get a look that's freakishly close to the real Windows 7 start menu, open the menu settings and in the Backup button click Save to XML to save your current layout. Save it in a place you can find it later.
6. Open the menu settings and click Load from XML in the Backup button and navigate to the folder where you saved the skin files and select the file named Windows-7.xml. Click OK to apply. The skin will be applied and settings to make it close to Windows 7 will be set. However, you will need to set the taskbar texture and start button manually because the taskbar textures are different depending on which side of the screen the taskbar is on, and the start buttons are scaled for different DPIs. You can modify most settings as usual. To preserve the Windows 7 look, don't change the glass color intensity options in the skin, the start menu opacity, glass color, or the taskbar opacity and color.

You're all done now. Enjoy your Windows 7 look!
*Note*: The taskbar texture is for when the taskbar is on the bottom, however if you prefer your taskbar on another side of the screen, simply change the taskbar texture and border values, then restart the start menu. The borders should be: For taskbar on the bottom - horizontal 0,0 vertical 2,0 • For taskbar on the top - horizontal 0,0 vertical 0,2 • For taskbar on the right - horizontal 2,0 vertical 0,0 • For taskbar on the left - horizontal 0,2 vertical 0,0
