# Windows 7 skin
This is a Windows 7-style skin for Open-Shell Menu. You can download Open-Shell Menu [here](https://github.com/open-shell-menu/releases/latest/). I tweaked the built-in Windows Aero skin as well as [this guy's](https://github.com/CTVCAM8) Windows 7 start menu clone ([link](http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5824)) to get the look as close as I could to the real Windows 7 start menu. Mostly I just changed some of the default options, and removed some bitmaps. It should work all right, but if you do find something that isn't quite right, [submit an issue](https://github.com/Win761/Windows-7-skin/issues/new/choose) and I'll look into it. The skin was built with [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/).
## Installation
1. Download the skin from [Releases](https://github.com/Win761/Windows-7-skin/releases/latest/).
2. Unzip the archive anywhere you want (just be sure you know where it is.)
3. Copy the skin to your Open-Shell skins directory (typically C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins).
4. Copy the icons folder, the start button, and the taskbar textures to this folder: C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\OpenShell.
5. Optionally, to get a look that's freakishly close to the real Windows 7 start menu, open the menu settings and in the Backup button click Save to XML.
6. Open the menu settings and click Load from XML in the Backup button and navigate to the folder where you saved the skin files and select the file named Windows-7.xml. Click OK and you will see a prompt that you have to restart the start menu with instructions to do so. Click OK on that prompt and restart the start menu
7. The skin with a taskbar texture and custom start button should be applied now. You can modify most settings as usual. To preserve the Windows 7 look, don't change the glass color intensity options in the skin, the start menu opacity, glass color, or the taskbar opacity and color.

You're all done now. Enjoy your Windows 7 look!
*Note*: The taskbar texture is for when the taskbar is on the bottom, however if you prefer your taskbar on another side of the screen, simply change the taskbar texture and border values, then restart the start menu. The borders should be: For taskbar on the bottom - horizontal 0,0 vertical 2,0 • For taskbar on the top - horizontal 0,0 vertical 0,2 • For taskbar on the right - horizontal 2,0 vertical 0,0 • For taskbar on the left - horizontal 0,2 vertical 0,0
## What you can do with this
Feel free to modify this skin as you wish. It can be used as a template to create your own skin, or you can modify it however you want. If it's still the same kind of skin (A Windows 7 lookalike) I will ask that you attribute my skin as the original. (For example you can state in your readme that you modified this skin, and provide a link to this repo.)
